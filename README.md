This is the code for the electronic bulletin board named FAWNA, which uses an ESP32 microcontroller implementing Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to connect to an Android device using the [FAWNA app](https://github.com/FAWNA-App/Fawna-App). The ESP32-powered FAWNA hub uses Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) to read messages being sent from an Android device to the FAWNA hub to write/post those messages to the e-bulletin board hosted on the hub.

# Future Work

* Implement a Bluetooth mesh network with multiple ESP32-powered FAWNA hubs and Android devices
* The e-bulletin board is currently being hosted on the Android devices using the FAWNA app and needs to be switched over to the ESP32-powered FAWNA hub
