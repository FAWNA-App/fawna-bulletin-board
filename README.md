This is a networking demo made from connecting an ESP32 microcontroller to an Android phone using Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) and show the Universal Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) advertised by the the ESP32 to the Android phone using the BLE Simulator app from the F-Droid app store.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I need to buy more ESP32s and build a Bluetooth mesh network with them
* The UUIDs need to have more uniqueness in their values
* I need to handle accepting messages
